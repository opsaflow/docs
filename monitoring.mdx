## Overview

Rivestack provides built-in monitoring for all HA clusters. Metrics are collected via Prometheus exporters running on each node, with data available through the dashboard or API.

<Info>Monitoring is available on **HA clusters** only. Free tier databases show basic usage metrics.</Info>

## Dashboard metrics

Navigate to the **Metrics** tab of your HA cluster to view real-time and historical data.

### Time ranges

Select from three predefined ranges:

| Range | Sampling interval |
|-------|------------------|
| 1 hour | 1 minute |
| 24 hours | 10 minutes |
| 7 days | 1 hour |

### PostgreSQL metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **TPS** | Transactions per second (commits + rollbacks) |
| **Active connections** | Current number of active connections |
| **Cache hit ratio** | Buffer cache effectiveness (higher is better) |
| **Disk usage** | PostgreSQL data directory size and total disk usage |
| **Replication lag** | Time and byte lag for replica nodes |
| **Tuple operations** | Rows fetched, inserted, updated, and deleted per second |
| **Deadlocks** | Number of deadlocks detected |

### System metrics (per node)

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CPU usage** | User, system, and total CPU percentage |
| **Memory usage** | Used, free, cached, and total memory |
| **Disk I/O** | Read and write throughput (KB/s) |
| **Network I/O** | Received and transmitted throughput (KB/s) |
| **Disk space** | Used and total disk space with usage percentage |

## Cluster health

The dashboard shows a real-time health status for each cluster:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Healthy** | All nodes are running and reachable |
| **Degraded** | Some nodes are healthy, but not all |
| **Critical** | No nodes are responding |

Health status is also visible on the main dashboard as a badge on each cluster card, alongside a TPS sparkline chart showing recent transaction throughput.

### Node topology

The **Topology** tab shows each node in your cluster with:

- Node name and role (primary or replica)
- Current state (streaming, in archive recovery, stopped)
- Replication lag (for replicas)
- Timeline number

## Accessing metrics

### Dashboard

The easiest way to view metrics is through the Rivestack dashboard at [app.rivestack.io](https://app.rivestack.io). Charts update automatically with the selected time range.


## Alerts and notifications

Rivestack sends email notifications for key events:

- Cluster provisioning complete
- Backup success or failure
- Restore operations
- Node scaling operations
- Cluster health changes

Configure notification preferences in **Settings** from the dashboard sidebar.
