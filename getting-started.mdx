## Create your first cluster

### Step 1: Sign up

    3. Select **Free** as the plan.
    4. Choose your **region** (EU, US, or Asia).
    5. Click **Create**.

    Your database is ready immediately. You'll see it on your dashboard with connection details.

       | Scale | 8 | 16 GB | 295 GB | $59/node/mo |
    6. Choose the **number of nodes** (1-3). We recommend 2 or more for high availability.

    <Info>Provisioning typically takes 3-5 minutes. You can watch the progress in real time on the dashboard.</Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Connect

Once your database is ready, navigate to the **Connection** tab to find your credentials:

- **Host** — Your unique endpoint (e.g., `rs-abc12345.eu-central.db.rivestack.io`)
- **Port** — `5432`
- **Database** — Your database name
- **Username** — Your database user
- **Password** — Generated on creation (copy it from the dashboard)
- **SSL Mode** — `require` (always enforced)

Your connection string looks like this:

```
postgresql://username:password@rs-abc12345.eu-central.db.rivestack.io:5432/mydb?sslmode=require
```
