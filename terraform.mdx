## Coming soon

The Rivestack Terraform provider is under development. It will let you manage databases, clusters, and backups as code.

### Planned resources

```hcl
# Example of planned syntax (not yet available)

resource "rivestack_cluster" "production" {
  name        = "my-app-prod"
  region      = "eu-central"
  server_type = "growth"
  nodes       = 3

  backup {
    schedule  = "0 3 * * *"
    retention = 14
  }
}

resource "rivestack_database" "app" {
  cluster_id = rivestack_cluster.production.id
  name       = "myapp"
  extensions = ["vector", "pg_trgm"]
}
```

### Planned features

- **Cluster management** — Create, update, and delete HA clusters
- **Database management** — Provision databases and manage extensions
- **Backup configuration** — Set schedules and retention policies
- **Import existing resources** — Bring current infrastructure under Terraform management

## In the meantime

You can use the [Rivestack API](/api-reference/introduction) to automate database management programmatically.
