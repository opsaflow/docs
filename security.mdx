## Encryption

### In transit

All connections to Rivestack databases **require SSL/TLS**. Unencrypted connections are rejected at the protocol level.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| SSL mode | `require` (enforced) |
| TLS version | TLS 1.2+ |
| Certificate | Signed by trusted public CA |

No CA certificate download is needed — standard PostgreSQL clients trust the certificate automatically.

```
postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/mydb?sslmode=require
```

### At rest

- **Database storage**: Encrypted at the volume level on all nodes
- **Backups**: Encrypted in S3-compatible object storage
- **WAL archives**: Encrypted alongside backups

## Network security

### Private networking

Database nodes communicate over private networks. Only the load balancer endpoint is exposed to the public internet.

### Port access

| Port | Service | Access |
|------|---------|--------|
| 5432 | PostgreSQL (primary) | Via load balancer |
| 5001 | Read replicas | Via load balancer |
| 5002 | Sync replicas | Via load balancer |
| 5003 | Async replicas | Via load balancer |

## Authentication

- **Database users**: Username/password authentication over SSL
- **Dashboard**: Authenticated via Auth0 with email verification
- **API**: API key authentication (used internally by the Terraform provider)

## Infrastructure

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Provider** | Hetzner Cloud |
| **Data centers** | EU (Falkenstein, Germany), US (Virginia, USA) |
| **Node isolation** | Dedicated VMs per HA cluster |
| **Internal communication** | Private network between cluster nodes |
| **Backups** | Stored in S3-compatible object storage, separate from database nodes |

## Compliance

| Standard | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **GDPR** | EU Central region stores all data within the EU |
| **Encryption in transit** | Enforced on all connections |
| **Encryption at rest** | All storage volumes and backups |
