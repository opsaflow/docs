title: "Scaling"
description: "Scale your PostgreSQL cluster by adding or removing nodes"
---

## Overview

Rivestack HA clusters support horizontal scaling by adding or removing nodes. You can scale between 1 and 3 nodes per cluster. Scaling operations are performed through the dashboard and are handled by our automated provisioning system.

## Node limits

| | Minimum | Maximum | Default |
|-|---------|---------|---------|
| **Nodes** | 1 | 3 | 2 |

<Info>We recommend running at least 2 nodes for production workloads to maintain high availability during failures.</Info>

## Add a node

1. Navigate to your cluster's detail page in the dashboard.
2. Open the **Management** tab.
3. Click **Add Node**.
4. Review the cost impact (adds one node at your current plan's per-node price).
5. Confirm the operation.

### What happens

- A new server is provisioned in the same region as your cluster.
- PostgreSQL is installed and configured to match your cluster settings.
- The new node joins the cluster as a **replica** and begins streaming replication from the primary.
- Prometheus exporters are configured for monitoring.
- The operation typically takes 3-5 minutes.
- You can track progress in real time via the dashboard.

## Remove a node

1. Navigate to your cluster's detail page.
2. Open the **Management** tab.
3. Click **Remove Node**.
4. Select the node to remove from the list.
5. Type the node name to confirm.
6. Confirm the operation.

### What happens

- The selected node is removed from the cluster.
- If the removed node was a replica, no failover occurs.
- If the removed node was the primary, Patroni automatically promotes a replica to primary before removal.
- The server is decommissioned.
- Your subscription is updated to reflect the new node count.

<Warning>You cannot remove a node if it would bring your cluster below 1 node. You also cannot remove nodes while another scaling or configuration operation is in progress.</Warning>

## Scaling constraints

- **One operation at a time**: You cannot add or remove nodes while another job (backup, restore, scaling, or configuration) is in progress.
- **Cluster must be active**: Scaling is only available for clusters in an `active` state.
- **No vertical scaling yet**: To change server type (e.g., Starter to Growth), create a new cluster and migrate your data. Vertical scaling is on our roadmap.

## Billing impact

Node changes take effect immediately on your subscription:

- **Adding a node** increases your monthly cost by one unit of your plan price (e.g., +$39/mo for Growth).
- **Removing a node** decreases your monthly cost accordingly.
- Billing is prorated within the current billing cycle.

## Server types

If you need more resources, choose a larger server type when creating a new cluster:

| Type | vCPUs | RAM | Available Storage | Price/node |
|------|-------|-----|-------------------|-----------|
| Starter | 2 | 4 GB | 55 GB | $29/mo |
| Growth | 4 | 8 GB | 135 GB | $39/mo |
| Scale | 8 | 16 GB | 295 GB | $59/mo |

Storage listed is fully available for your PostgreSQL database. An additional 20 GB is reserved for the OS on each node.
