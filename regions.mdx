## Available regions

Rivestack databases can be deployed in the following regions:

| Region | Location | Identifier | Free | HA |
|--------|----------|------------|------|-----|
| **EU Central** | Falkenstein, Germany | `eu-central` | Yes | Yes |
| **US East** | Virginia, USA | `us-east` | Yes | Yes |

<Info>All regions include the same features, performance, and pricing.</Info>

## Choosing a region

Select the region closest to your application servers for the lowest latency. Once a database or cluster is created, its region cannot be changed.

| Your app is hosted in | Recommended region |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Europe | EU Central |
| North America | US East |
| Other | Choose the nearest |

## Region details

### EU Central — Falkenstein, Germany

- **Provider**: Hetzner Cloud
- **Data residency**: All data stored within the EU
- **Compliance**: GDPR-compliant data processing

### US East — Virginia, USA

## Cross-region considerations

- Each database lives in a single region. There is no built-in cross-region replication.
- Backups are stored in the same region as your database.
- For multi-region architectures, create separate clusters in each region and handle replication at the application level.
